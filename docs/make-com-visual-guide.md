# Visual Guide: Finding the Correct Scheduler in Make.com

I am truly sorry for the frustration. Here is a visual guide to walk you through the process step-by-step.

### **Step 1: Start with the Plus Button**

In your new scenario, click the large purple plus `(+)` button in the center of the screen.

### **Step 2: IGNORE The Search Bar and Scroll Down**

A new window will pop up showing a list of applications. **Do not use the search bar at the top.**

Instead, scroll all the way to the bottom of the list.

![A screenshot of the 'Choose an application' window in Make.com. The search bar at the top is crossed out with a red X. An arrow points downwards, indicating to scroll down the list of app icons.](https://placehold.co/800x400/f0f4f9/000000?text=2.%20IMPORTANT:%20Do%20NOT%20search.%20Scroll%20down.)

### **Step 3: Find and Select the "Scheduler"**

At the very bottom of the list, you will find the built-in Make.com tools. The **Scheduler** is the first one. It has a **purple clock icon**.

Click on it.

### **Step 4: Choose the Trigger**

After you click the correct Scheduler, a small menu will appear next to it. Choose **"Every Day"**.

![The Scheduler module is shown selected, and a context menu has appeared next to it with options like 'Every Day', 'Specific Dates', etc. The 'Every Day' option is highlighted.](https://placehold.co/800x400/f0f4f9/000000?text=4.%20Choose%20'Every%20Day')

### **Success! No API Key Needed**

A simple dialog box will now appear, only asking for the **Time**. It will **not** ask for an API key.

![The final, correct dialog box. It has a single input field labeled 'Time' and an OK button. There is no mention of API keys or connections.](https://placehold.co/800x400/e6f7e9/000000?text=Success!%20This%20box%20will%20appear.%0ANo%20API%20key%20is%20needed.)
